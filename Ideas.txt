Final Idea - 
->First Tokenize
->Then Convert to Ngrams and store unique Ngrams in a BST
->then compare the Ngrams and find Jaccard Similarity.
-> Ngram method
-> bigrams & trigram also
->string compare for token comparison



arr [string]
This is coep -> 
This is vjti

This is                                            coep
this is         vjti
